## Overview

This project focuses on constructing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier to recognize handwritten letters from the A-Z dataset. The primary objectives include working with large datasets, understanding statistical learning using ANN, and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 785 columns:
- The first column represents letters A to Z, encoded as integers (0 to 25).
- Columns 2 to 785 contain grayscale pixel values (0 to 255) of a 28x28 image.

## Dataset Sources

- [NIST Special Database 19](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19)
- [A_Z Handwritten Data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)
